# Next-Generation-Character-Rendering
My implementation for character rendering in unity URP, including eyes、face and hair.

For face I will try to render with 4s、5s and Pre-integration algrithmn.

For eyes, I will take a multi-layer eye structures method to render for a more realistic representation.Since I can't share the model and texture resources, I will only share the algorithm and shader code.
